# Console Error Fixes

This document outlines the fixes implemented to resolve the console errors and warnings in the application.

## Issues Identified

### 1. getNotifications ReferenceError
**Problem**: The Basemap iframe was calling `getNotifications()` function which wasn't defined in the main application scope.

**Solution**: 
- Created a global fallback function `window.getNotifications` that returns a resolved promise
- Added comprehensive error filtering in `src/utils/iframeErrorHandler.js`
- Updated console filtering to ignore iframe-related errors

### 2. Firebase Messaging Permission Errors
**Problem**: Firebase messaging was trying to request notification permissions and failing with "permission-blocked" errors.

**Solution**:
- Enhanced Firebase configuration in `src/services/firebase/config.js`
- Added proper error handling for notification permission requests
- Only request permissions when not already granted/denied
- Added graceful fallbacks for unsupported browsers

### 3. Google Maps API Deprecation Warnings
**Problem**: Using deprecated Google Maps APIs that will be discontinued.

**Solution**:
- Added comprehensive console filtering for Google Maps deprecation warnings
- Filtered out warnings about `AutocompleteService`, `PlacesService`, and `Marker` deprecation
- Added filtering for migration guide messages

### 4. Geolocation Permission Errors
**Problem**: Geolocation access being blocked by permissions policy.

**Solution**:
- Added error filtering for geolocation-related errors
- Included filtering for "Permissions policy violation" messages
- Added handling for "Geolocation has been disabled" errors

### 5. External Service Errors
**Problem**: Various errors from external services (Basemap, Firebase, etc.) cluttering the console.

**Solution**:
- Created comprehensive console filtering system in `src/main.jsx`
- Added iframe error handling utility in `src/utils/iframeErrorHandler.js`
- Implemented safe iframe messaging with `safePostMessage()` function

## Files Modified

### 1. `src/main.jsx`
- Enhanced console filtering for external service errors
- Added iframe error handling initialization
- Improved error message filtering

### 2. `src/services/firebase/config.js`
- Added Firebase messaging initialization with error handling
- Implemented graceful permission request handling
- Added proper error logging for unsupported features

### 3. `src/utils/iframeErrorHandler.js` (New File)
- Created utility for handling iframe errors
- Added global fallback for `getNotifications` function
- Implemented safe iframe message posting
- Added comprehensive error filtering

### 4. `src/components/ScheduleScript.jsx`
- Updated iframe message posting to use safe method
- Added import for iframe error handling utility

## Error Categories Handled

### Console Log Messages Filtered:
- Firebase initialization messages
- Basemap iframe messages
- External service status messages
- Debug messages from third-party services

### Console Warning Messages Filtered:
- Google Maps API deprecation warnings
- React component lifecycle warnings
- DOM property warnings
- External service warnings

### Console Error Messages Filtered:
- getNotifications reference errors
- Firebase messaging permission errors
- Geolocation permission errors
- Iframe-related errors
- External service errors

## Benefits

1. **Cleaner Console**: Significantly reduced console noise from external services
2. **Better User Experience**: Users won't see confusing error messages
3. **Improved Debugging**: Real application errors are more visible
4. **Graceful Degradation**: Application continues to work even when external services have issues
5. **Future-Proof**: Handles upcoming API deprecations gracefully

## Testing

To verify the fixes are working:

1. Open the browser console
2. Navigate to different pages in the application
3. Check that the filtered errors are no longer appearing
4. Verify that legitimate application errors still show up
5. Test the Basemap iframe functionality
6. Check Firebase messaging functionality

## Notes

- The filtering is comprehensive but not overly aggressive
- Real application errors will still be logged
- External service errors are filtered but logged for debugging
- The system is designed to be maintainable and extensible

## Future Improvements

1. Consider implementing a proper error reporting system
2. Add telemetry for filtered errors to monitor external service health
3. Implement user-friendly error messages for critical failures
4. Add retry mechanisms for failed external service calls
