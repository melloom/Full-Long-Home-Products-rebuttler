      pt1: "I completely understand where you're coming from. But let me ask you something that might change your perspective - what's the biggest headache you're dealing with at home right now? Is it skyrocketing energy bills that keep going up every month? Safety concerns that keep you up at night? Or maybe it's the constant maintenance issues that seem to never end? Because I've seen hundreds of customers who said 'not interested' until they realized they were literally throwing away $300-$500 every single month on problems that could have been solved once and for all. One of my customers, Mike from your area, was paying $450 a month in energy bills alone. He said 'not interested' for 6 months, then finally let me show him the numbers. He was shocked to discover he had been wasting over $2,700 in just 6 months on energy inefficiencies that could have been fixed for $3,500. That's money he'll never get back. What's your biggest pain point right now? I'd love to show you exactly how much it's costing you.",
      pt2: "Here's what I can do for you right now - I can give you a complete analysis of what your current situation is costing you, show you exactly how much you'll save with our solution, and prove to you that it pays for itself within 6-12 months. Most people are absolutely shocked when they see the real numbers. For example, Sarah from your neighborhood was spending $380 a month on energy bills. After our solution, she's now paying $120 a month. That's $260 in savings every single month, which means our $3,200 solution paid for itself in just 12 months. Since then, she's been saving $3,120 every year. Would you be open to seeing exactly what your situation is costing you right now? I can show you the numbers in black and white, and if it doesn't make financial sense for you, I'll be the first to tell you. But I think you'll be surprised by what you see."

Sarah told me on the phone 'I wish I had listened to you when you first called. I could have prevented this whole mess.' She's not the only one - 8 out of 10 people who say 'not interested' end up calling us back within 6 months, usually during an emergency or when they realize how much money they're wasting. Just last week, I had 3 customers who said 'not interested' 6 months ago call me back because their energy bills hit $500+ a month. They all said the same thing - 'I wish I had done this sooner.'

For example, the Johnson family down the street was spending $420 a month on energy bills. After our solution, they're now paying $140 a month. That's $280 in savings every month, which means our $3,200 solution paid for itself in just 11 months. Since then, they've been saving $3,360 every year.

      pt1: "I understand completely. But let me ask you something personal that might change your perspective - what's more important to you: saving money or protecting your family? Because I've seen families who said 'not interested' until their child got hurt because of an issue they could have prevented for $2,000. Just last month, I had a customer named Lisa who said 'not interested' in January. In March, her 8-year-old son got an electrical shock from an outlet that could have been fixed for $1,800. Thankfully he was okay, but the medical bills were $3,500, and the emotional trauma was priceless. Lisa called me crying saying 'I wish I had listened to you in January. My son's safety is worth more than $1,800.' I'm not trying to scare you, but I am trying to make you think about what's really important. Is saving $2,000 worth risking your family's safety? Most people say no when they really think about it. What's your family's safety worth to you? I can show you exactly what safety issues might exist in your home and exactly how much it would cost to fix them. Would you rather be safe now or sorry later?",

I have testimonials from families who were glad they took action, and stories from families who wish they had. For example, the Martinez family had an electrical issue that was causing flickering lights. They said 'not interested' until their daughter got a shock from an outlet. They ended up paying $4,200 for emergency repairs and medical bills. If they had fixed it proactively, it would have cost $1,800. Mrs. Martinez told me 'I would pay anything to keep my family safe. I wish I had done this sooner.' What's your family's safety worth to you? I can show you exactly what we can do to protect them."

Because I can show you exactly why we're different and why our customers are so much happier. Our customers save 40% more than people who go with our competitors, and we have a 98% satisfaction rate. But here's what really sets us apart - we don't just install and leave. We provide ongoing support, maintenance, and monitoring. Most of our competitors install and disappear. We're still here 5, 10, even 15 years later. Just last week, I had a customer named David who was considering one of our competitors. They offered him a $2,800 solution. We offered him a $3,200 solution. He went with the competitor to save $400. Six months later, he called me because the competitor's solution wasn't working properly, and they wouldn't return his calls. He ended up paying us $3,200 to fix what the competitor did wrong, plus the $2,800 he already paid them. That's $6,000 total vs. $3,200 if he had gone with us from the start. David told me 'I wish I had gone with you first. The $400 I saved cost me $2,800.' What if I could show you a side-by-side comparison of what you'd get with us vs. our competitors?

For example, the Wilson family went with a competitor to save $500. Two years later, they had to pay us $4,200 to fix what the competitor did wrong. They could have had our solution for $3,200 from the start. That's $4,700 total vs. $3,200. Would you be open to seeing a complete comparison? I think you'll be surprised by what you see."

That's $14,200 total vs. $2,200 if he had been proactive. Robert told me 'I wish I had listened to you in January. This could have been prevented.' Think about it this way - if something goes wrong in the next 6 months, will you be glad you saved $2,000 now, or will you wish you had spent $2,000 to prevent a $10,000 problem?

      pt1: "I understand completely. But let me ask you something that might change your perspective - what's the biggest headache you're dealing with at home right now? Is it high energy bills that keep going up every month? Safety concerns that keep you up at night? Or maybe it's the constant maintenance issues that seem to never end? Because I've seen hundreds of people who said 'not interested' until they realized they were literally throwing away $200-$400 every single month on problems that could have been solved once and for all. One of my customers, Mike from your area, was paying $450 a month in energy bills alone. He said 'not interested' for 6 months, then finally let me show him the numbers. He was shocked to discover he had been wasting over $2,700 in just 6 months on energy inefficiencies that could have been fixed for $3,500. That's money he'll never get back. Another customer, Sarah, was spending $380 a month on energy bills. After our solution, she's now paying $120 a month. That's $260 in savings every month, which means our $3,200 solution paid for itself in just 12 months. Since then, she's been saving $3,120 every year. What's your biggest pain point right now? I'd love to show you exactly how much it's costing you.",
      pt2: "Here's what I can do for you right now - I can give you a complete analysis of what your current situation is costing you, show you exactly how much you'll save with our solution, and prove to you that it pays for itself within 6-12 months. Most people are absolutely shocked when they see the real numbers. For example, the Johnson family was spending $420 a month on energy bills. After our solution, they're now paying $140 a month. That's $280 in savings every month, which means our $3,200 solution paid for itself in just 11 months. Since then, they've been saving $3,360 every year. Mrs. Johnson told me 'I wish I had done this years ago. I was literally throwing away $3,360 every year.' Would you be open to seeing exactly what your situation is costing you right now? I can show you the numbers in black and white, and if it doesn't make financial sense for you, I'll be the first to tell you. But I think you'll be surprised by what you see."
